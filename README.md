# Product_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
This is a basic sentiment analysis model which will perform sentiment analysis on product reviews given by buyers on Amazon. Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining) refers to the use of natural language processing (NLP), text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information from the source materials. This project will help the user to make a more informed choice.
